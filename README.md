# Vibe Drop AI

Vibe Drop AI is a Python-based AI assistant for generating RnB and lo-fi chord progressions and melodies.

The goal is to:
- Train models on MIDI and chord data
- Generate musical ideas that can be drag-and-dropped as MIDI into FL Studio
- Eventually integrate with FL Studio's Python scripting for a `plugin-like` experience
